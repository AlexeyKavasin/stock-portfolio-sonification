## Stocks Portfolio Sonification

ðŸŽ¹ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµ 

Using Google Sheets (see more [here](https://blog.sheetgo.com/google-sheets-formulas/googlefinance-formula-google-sheets/)) you can built and monitor your financial portfolio in real-time.

This tool turns data from Google Sheets into inifnite arpeggio (ascending or descending). The sound depends on the current market rates of specific stocks in portfolio and the overall profit or loss at the moment. The stocks information is updated every certain amount of time (5 min).

E.g. this is what a growing portfolio sounds like: [ascending.webm](https://github.com/AlexeyKavasin/stock-portfolio-sonification/assets/9008727/c13e524b-1ab2-474e-9661-a110f140129c)


P.S Note this is an art project. Sonification is really much more complicated.
